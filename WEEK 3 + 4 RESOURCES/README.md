# Week 3 + 4: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Neural Networks

Let's finally get started with neural networks! 

Neural networks are a class of machine learning techniques in which a computer learns to perform a task by analyzing training examples. They are pivotal in machine learning, serving as dynamic models that learn intricate patterns from data

[**Here**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&si=sD11yZ8JipPpnL4o) is a YouTube playlist that explains neural networks very nicely, do go through it!

GO through the following PDFs provided: 
1. [**Neural Networks**]
2. [**Gradient Descent**]
3. [**Backpropagation**]
4. [**CNN**]

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is a flexible and dynamic library, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers working on machine learning and deep learning projects.

[**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&pp=ygUcbmV1cmFsIG5ldHdvcmsgd2l0aCBweXRvcmNoIA%3D%3D) is the link to a YouTube playlist on Deep Learning using PyTorch which is a good source to start with. We recommend watching the video before attempting this week's assignment, as it will help you with the code.

Alternatively, you could watch [**this YouTube tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0) as well.

You can additionally also follow a few detailed courses like https:[codebasics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7CxAacxVndI4bE_o3BDtO&si=u9QP0ToIJ8g2DT-7)
Or MIT lecture series for the same https:[MIT Lecture](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI&si=eJaVT41ls8D08PtV).
Although this is completely optional!

Will add more resources soon.
